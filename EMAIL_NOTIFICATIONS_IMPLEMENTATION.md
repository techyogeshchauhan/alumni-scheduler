## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Code Changes Made:**

#### **1. Event Creation (app.py lines 1103-1155)**
```python
# Send email notifications to selected alumni only
if assigned_alumni:
    # Get details of selected alumni
    selected_alumni = list(users_collection.find(
        {"_id": {"$in": [ObjectId(alumni_id) for alumni_id in assigned_alumni if alumni_id]}},
        {"name": 1, "email": 1, "grad_year": 1}
    ))
    
    if selected_alumni:
        # Create personalized email for each selected alumni
        for alumni in selected_alumni:
            # HTML email template with event details
            send_notification_email([alumni["email"]], f"🎉 You're Invited: {title}", email_body)
```

#### **2. RSVP Response (app.py lines 1028-1073)**
```python
# Send notification email to admin about the RSVP
admin_users = list(users_collection.find({"is_admin": True, "is_active": True}, {"name": 1, "email": 1}))
if admin_users:
    for admin in admin_users:
        # HTML email template with RSVP details
        send_notification_email([admin["email"]], f"📝 New RSVP: {current_user.name} responded to {event['title']}", admin_email_body)
```

### **Email Templates:**

#### **Event Creation Email:**
- **Theme:** Blue/purple gradient
- **Icon:** 🎓 (graduation cap)
- **Design:** Professional card layout with event details

#### **RSVP Response Email:**
